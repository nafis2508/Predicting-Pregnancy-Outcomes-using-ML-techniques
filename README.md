# Pregnancy Outcomes Analysis in Kenya and Uganda

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze pregnancy outcomes in healthcare facilities in Kenya and Uganda using classical machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to predict and understand the key factors influencing these outcomes, leveraging data from maternity registers that have been improved through data strengthening efforts.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from a study described by the [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). It consists of anonymized patient-level delivery records, extracted monthly from maternity registers. These registers were enhanced as part of the PTBi trial to improve the accuracy and completeness of the data, with a particular emphasis on gestational age assessments.

## Techniques

### Data Preprocessing
- Data transformation, cleaning, and discretization were conducted to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Feature Selection
- Key features were selected to optimize model performance, reducing noise and improving accuracy.

## Models Implemented
The following machine learning models were applied and compared to evaluate their predictive capabilities:

- **ZeroR**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**

## Evaluation Metrics
The models were assessed using the following evaluation metrics:

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F-Measure**

These metrics helped determine the most effective approach for predicting pregnancy outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computing.
- **Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For implementing and documenting the analysis process.

## Results
The analysis highlights the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting pregnancy outcomes in the dataset. The findings provide insights into the key factors that influence these outcomes in healthcare facilities in Kenya and Uganda.
